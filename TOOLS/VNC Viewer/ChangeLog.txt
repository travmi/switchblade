	* vncviewer/VNCviewerApp32.cpp: A long-standing bug has been fixed
	- the logic to handle retries after authentication failures was

2003-07-10 15:53  const_k

	* winvnc/vncDesktop.cpp: Closing HKEY_CURRENT_USER properly on

	problem seems to be solved.

2003-07-10 15:33  const_k

	* winvnc/: vncAdvancedProperties.cpp, vncProperties.cpp: Restored
	the code closing the HKCU registry hive. This code was removed to
	workaround a password reset problem, but had introduced another
	issue that can be considered even worse. Now we should find other
	ways to fix old password reset problem.

2003-03-08 13:17  const_k

	* winvnc/: WinVNC.cpp, WinVNC.h: Implemented a possibility to
	specify port numbers with winvnc -connect option, using the
	"host::port" format.

2003-02-22 22:57  const_k

	* winvnc/.cvsignore: Ignoring WinVNC.log.bak as well.

2003-02-22 10:41  const_k

	vncviewer/omnithread/.cvsignore, vncviewer/res/.cvsignore,
	vncviewer/zlib/.cvsignore, winvnc/VNCHooks/.cvsignore,
	winvnc/libjpeg/.cvsignore, winvnc/zlib/.cvsignore: MS-DOS line
	endings have been replaced with Unix linefeeds.

2003-02-22 10:35  const_k

	vncviewer/omnithread/.cvsignore, vncviewer/res/.cvsignore,
	vncviewer/zlib/.cvsignore, winvnc/.cvsignore,
	winvnc/VNCHooks/.cvsignore, winvnc/libjpeg/.cvsignore,
	winvnc/zlib/.cvsignore: Added .cvsignore files.

2003-02-19 00:16  const_k

2003-02-19 00:14  const_k

	from user to default settings without user's intention.

2003-02-19 00:09  const_k

	* winvnc/vncAdvancedProperties.cpp: Removed a MessageBox() used for
	debugging purposes.

2003-02-05 15:03  const_k

	* winvnc/: vncAcceptDialog.cpp, vncClient.cpp: Major bugfix --
	handling of the QueryAllowNoPass option was seriously broken. In
	addition to solving this issue, this patch re-organizes and fixes
	the InitAuthenticate() function in several more ways. E.g. the
	order of checks is now different -- first it checks for disabled
	empty passwords and loopback connections, then it checks AuthHosts
	settings and shows the query dialog, and only after that it
	requests authentication if necessary. Now the InitAuthenticate()
	function is much more mature and its code is much more readable.

2003-01-31 05:46  const_k

	* TightVNC.iss: Included the logo/ directory into the installed Web
	site copy.  Shortcuts to ChangeLog and WhatsNew text files replaced

	* winvnc/vncKeymap.cpp: Eliminated compilation warnings under MS
	VC++.

2002-12-16 09:12  const_k

	* winvnc/vncKeymap.cpp: Ported keyboard handling changes from
	RealVNC 3.3.6. This should fix shift+arrows problems under

	* winvnc/: VSocket.cpp, vncDesktop.cpp: Reverted minor cleanups
	provided by Andrew van der Stock aimed to get rid of compilation
	warnings under Visual Studio 7. These changes in #include

	* README-bin.txt: Included a paragraph about donations.

2002-11-25 04:55  const_k

	* winvnc/: VSocket.cpp, VSocket.h: Now checking if an address is in
	use before the bind() call is optional and turned off by default.
	This lets WinVNC to listen on specified port numbers regardless of
	is the address is used by another process. If the display number is
	set to "auto", WinVNC will behave as usual -- it will find the
	lowest available display. One visible effect of this change is that
	the delay between starting up and showing the icon is greatly
	reduced.

	now will be resized after changing the preferences only if new
	scaling factor was set. Also, the window won't be centered after
	such a size change -- it will try to preserve its current position.
	In the full-screen mode, the viewer won't show the prompt each time
	the window size is changing.

2002-07-29 11:02  const

	* vncviewer/: ClientConnection.cpp, ClientConnection.h,

2001-08-09 06:12  const

	* vncviewer/: Makefile.bcc32, res/resource.h: DOS-style
	end-of-lines converted to Unix-style ones.

2001-08-09 03:48  const

	* winvnc/vncDesktop.cpp: DrawIconEx flags corrected, now custom
	cursors can be shown properly under both WinNT and Win95/Win98,
	regardless of settings related to local cursor support.

2001-08-05 05:37  const

	* winvnc/vncClient.cpp: Conflicts between VNC, TightVNC and
	TridiaVNC hopefully resolved.

2001-08-05 05:35  const

	* winvnc/Makefile.bcc32: New file, vncAdvancedProperties.cpp.

2001-08-05 05:34  const

	* winvnc/WinVNC.rc: DS_SETFOREGROUND flags removed -- not
	understood by Borland C++ 5.5.

2001-08-05 03:57  const

	vncDesktop.cpp, vncDesktop.h, vncEncoder.cpp, vncEncoder.h,
	vncService.cpp: RichCursor encoding is now fully supported. Code
	implementing cursor shape updates has been reorganized, large parts
	were rewritten; this should be the final version of the "local
	cursor" feature. Besides that, code cleanups in many places.

2001-07-18 09:26  const

	* vncviewer/ClientConnectionCursor.cpp: Bug fixed: vncviewer used
	to set cursor hotspot incorrectly on XCursor and RichCursor
	updates.

2001-03-13 04:52  const

	* vncviewer/ClientConnectionCursor.cpp: Bugfix: local cursor
	implementation allocated DC and bitmap on each cursor movement but
	failed to free these recources. On Win95/98, after GDI resources
	were exhausted, mouse movement leaved cursor trails on the screen.
	Current fix allocates DC and bitmap only on cursor shape updates
	and disposes them properly.

2001-03-13 04:44  const

	* build-bcc32.bat, vncviewer/omnithread/build-bcc32.bat,

	environment.

2001-03-11 10:13  const

	* winvnc/: vncClient.cpp, vncClient.h: Started work to implement
	cursor shape updates for every possible cursor shape. At this
	moment, a skeleton for new implementation has been prepared, the
	code has been re-organized, but basic functionality has remained
	the same.

2001-03-11 10:05  const

	* vncviewer/Log.cpp, winvnc/Log.cpp: CORE SDI fixes applied to fix
	buffer overflows reported 2001-01-29.

2001-03-10 11:41  const

	* winvnc/vncDesktop.cpp: The color depth is set to correct value in
	24-bit truecolor mode.	Original WinVNC always used to set depth =
	bitsPerPixel. This change notably improves performance of the Tight
	encoder in both compression ratios and encoding/decoding speed.

2001-03-10 11:35  const

	* winvnc/vncEncodeTight.cpp: The "gradient" filter enabled again.

2001-03-10 11:33  const

	Log.h, VNCOptions.cpp, VNCviewerApp.cpp, VNCviewerApp32.cpp,
	vncviewer.cpp, vncviewer.h: The name of global variable "log"
	changed to "vnclog".

2001-03-10 09:06  const

	* vncviewer/ClientConnectionTight.cpp: Bugfix: "gradient" filter
	was broken in non-24-bit color depths.

2001-03-10 09:05  const

	* vncviewer/VNCOptions.cpp: Default preferred encoding is now
	Tight.

2001-03-10 09:05  const

	* vncviewer/res/vncviewer.rc: Two version info blocks merged into
	one record.

2001-03-07 10:30  const

	* winvnc/tabletranstemplate.cpp: Workaround for buggy Borland C++
	5.5 compiler: pixel format translations from 24-bit colors worked
	incorrectly when optimizations were enabled.

2001-03-07 00:03  const

	* vncviewer/: ClientConnection.cpp, ClientConnection.h,
	ClientConnectionCursor.cpp: "Local cursor" implementation now works
	with scaling.

2001-03-06 23:56  const

	* winvnc/: vncEncodeTight.cpp, vncEncodeTight.h: Changes from
	current Unix version ported to Win32 code.  Minor formatting
	changes and code clean-ups.

2001-03-05 11:00  const

	* winvnc/vncEncodeTight.cpp: JPEG encoder worked incorrectly in
	16bpp mode (bug found by Martin Granell).

2001-03-05 10:03  const

	* vncviewer/ClientConnectionTight.cpp: Minor clean-ups and tiny
	formatting fix.

2001-03-05 09:39  const

	Finished porting to Borland C++ 5.5 compiler.  Global variable
	"log" in WinVNC changed to "vnclog".  Proper cooperation between
	threads in "local cursor" code.  Correct loading of configuration
	files where "compresslevel" or "quality" setting were not set. 
	Corrected path to libjpeg library in the vncviewer.dsw.  Minor code
